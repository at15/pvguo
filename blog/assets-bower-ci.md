## assets-bower-ci

A front-end assets management solution.

  Started this project because I am tired of writing GruntFile for every project.

Most of my vendor files are fixed and my own libraries don't change very often.

so it would be great if i only config my assets for each page using one json file.

`bower` is because it support download vendor using `bower` at first.
`ci` is because i use `Codeingiter` for some projects.
