# Jason Han

Got a chance to meet him during a lecture in sjtu, red sofa in media and design (???...)
Just notes about he has talk about and some reflection

## Notes

TODO: re order by importance or time sequence

- study in university is useless, especially in China.
- he always fail in university, so he is not afraid of it.
- it's a pity to live for money.
- success depends on luck, many people just bullshit about how they success.
- you need to try, other wise you will never know. DON'T spend all your time on thinking.
- you need to have passion for what you are doing, ownership ( I forgot where he mentioned this though). smart is not enough, the most successful are not the smartest.
- Internet is a bubble, it's unfair for programmers to earn as much as old professional in other area, and every field need hard work like programming. ( programmers should
not feel so good about themselves)
- read a lot of books, but don't go too deep for philosophy.  
- ali's tech is not so diao.
- 90's don't need to worry about future like they did, ie: his son.
- The key point for e-commerce is too keep data consistent. (? how to say 强一致性)

## Reflection

- university is not so useless, though many courses are out dated and won't use in a whole life, but it's will benefits
in some indirect ways, ie: thinking pattern. And it is a buffer for students, not all students can get used to society 
instantly, and they can go for master nad phd if they need more time. Besides, it's really a good time for enjoying your
life, have some date, some xxx, some xxx, some xxx. ( Pity I didn't and won't have any ... )

- He used to be top in high school, and he found he can't be top in sjtu, so he just review (or study the brand new) book
a week before test. While some other students are having good life all way through, thus they are afraid of failure while
he does not.

- money is a good thing, I don't think chasing money is a bad thing, at least I earn it. If I can't find passion for some
specific thing like change the world, at least I can have passion in getting more money to live better. Though having 1 billion
and 100 billion won't make a person happy, but don't have money when you or your family members want to buy something or in
hospital will make you sad in deed.

- yeah, if there is a secret, why should he tell you?

- the little horse cross river is an old story, but we are still making the same mistake these days.

- passion is e... every one have passion for their bright future, but most never try it or give up too early.

- e ... yeah, but most guys won't get a boom until they retire, which is same as other area.

- got to find some time for books, programming books are not so useful, just ask so experts and use it.

- tech is never so diao, unless it can work with your application. 
 
- He got a father like you, so ... 

- Split transition into small one, check on each step and do makeup, need to consider speed.

In general, I don't have much feeling....
