## stackoverflow experience

   Never use my stackoverflow account until last week
   
   - its javascript is blocked
   - don't think it's interesting to answer questions
   
   
   Why start using it
   
   - they say that a hight reputation in stackoverflow is good for finding job. So
     i think it may also benefits going abroad.
   - some questions are easy to answer.
   - practice english
   
   
   Something to remember
   
   - Don't answer question you don't know. google and paste will result in awkward situation
   - Don't waste time on questions that are too long or too short.
